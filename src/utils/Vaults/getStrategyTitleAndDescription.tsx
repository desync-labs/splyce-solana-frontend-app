      The Strategy utilizes funds in the FXD liquidation process. It uses
      several liquidity sources (Fathom DEX, XSwap, etc.) to liquidate risky
      positions in the FXD protocol. If there is insufficient liquidity in the
      market, the Strategy uses internally allocated funds to process the
      liquidation. All liquidation income is considered a gain. Possible
      liquidation debt is compensated by strategy gain and the FXD stability fee
      reserve.

      Tradeflow USD is an investment grade Commodity finance fund that has had a
      successful track record since 2018. The TradeFlow funds currently manage
      around $130 million in assets. The TradeFlow funds focus on supporting
      Small Medium size firms in their import/export transactions of physical
      commodities e.g. non-perishable food crops, agricultural farming inputs,
      metals for recycling and some energy products. The fund invests in insured
      physical commodity transactions with a maximum duration of 90 days. This
      means it provides financing for the import and export of physical
